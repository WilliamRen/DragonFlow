DragonFlow
==========

An Android app to browse StackOverflow and other Stack Exchange websites.

This application was created as a school assignment over a period of two weeks. As a result, even though this application is fully functional, it is far from complete and not entirely ready to be packaged and published.

To-do
------

- Add more robust error-checking and exception handling
- Polish UI
- Add plenty of icons to give information such as whether a question has been answered yet or not, the accepted answer etc.
